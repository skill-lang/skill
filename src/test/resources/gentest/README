this folder contains generic tests.
tests are created using the command line interface and its arguments.
if the frist line is of the form '#!' <id>, then the <id> is used as package name and a respective test is generated.
this feature can be used to create skill specifications that should not be used as tests directly.

tests will be created for all .skill-files and all known generator implementations.
output directory will be testsuites/<language name>

API tests are generated for each JSON file in a subdirectory that also contains
a .skill-specification.
A JSON file contains an object on top level.
The fields are "should", "kind" and "obj"; other fields will be ignored.
- "should" either "fail" or "succeed"; defaults to "succeed"
- "kind" a name for a test category; defaults to "core"
- "obj" definitions of named objects. (JSON Type Object)
Named objects map their name to an object definition.
An object definition is an object with a single field.
The name of that field is the name of the type to be allocated.
The value is an object, that sets values for each field of that type.
Field values use JSON-equivalents where obvious.
Reference types use Strings.
Strings are used as-is.
Therefore the schema is:
{
   ("should" : "fail",)?
   ("kind" : <name :string>,)?
   "obj" : {
      <name : string> : {
          <type : string> : {
              <field : string> : <value : value>*
          }
      }*
   }
}
