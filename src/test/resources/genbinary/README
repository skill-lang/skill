this directory structure contains binary files that will be fed into tests

the first level contains directories for each test and an "<all>" directory,
 that will be used for all tests

the second level contains "accept" and "fail" directories that contains files
 that shall be accepted or rejected respectively

the "<empty>" folder will be used iff there is no folder with a matching name.
 this is basically a starting point for new tests. "<empty>" tests will check
 against "<all>"
